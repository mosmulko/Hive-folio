  #GALLERY-LAYOUT
\*------------------------------------*/

/**
 * Gallery is organized into 3 sections, first section that gets filled is a 
 * middle section, then left and right get's filled last.
 * Layout: 
 ** mobile-portrait: 
 *** no fillers visible, all sections lined up as single column
 *** each column and cards within fill 100% of the available space
 *
 ** wide screens- mobile-landscape, tablet both orientations: 
 *** two columns are side by side, third section is display as a row wrap to visually
 *** fill the spaces of the 2 columns. Columns width is dependant on the card 
 *** height, as the first card of the middle column (2nd section) needs to
 *** be fully visible in the viewport. 
 *** First and last elements are fillers.
 *
 ** very wide screens - desktop:
 *** each section is displayed as a column, which are organised side by side
 *** with first cards of side columns being fully visible in the viewport.
 *
 * Note: each card's width == 81.362% * height && height == 122.9% * width
 *
 * Note-2: The default css layout is for when all 3 sections
 * have an even number of projects. Other scenarios are controlled by JS in
 * gallery.js file, but styles for these scenarios are in this CSS file.
